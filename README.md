# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors game project

Project to mimic the rock paper scissors game
within the browser

Start the game
Ask the user for an input
(must be rock, paper, scissors)
otherwise it asks for another input.

Compare to the computer choice - 
choose randomly between the three.

If rock vs paper, paper wins. 
If paper vs scissors, scissors wins.
If scissors vs rock, rock wins.
If the same - play again.

Capture the score as a running total.
